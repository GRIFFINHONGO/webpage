        <p style="font-size: 25;"  ><b>GAME DAY 5</b> <br> <u>Kabarak University</u> headed to <i>Nairobi</i> to face the log leader <u>Nondiescript Rfc</u> at the Ngong race course in what would turn out to be a one sided match with the varsity side being shown no mercy. The game was a very physical game but that did not scare the men in red and white stripes since that is just how rugby is in the end. However besides being quite a physicalgame with five players from Kabarak getting injuries the varsity side could not keep up in the end and ended up suffering a heavy defeat of <b>46:6</b> </p>
