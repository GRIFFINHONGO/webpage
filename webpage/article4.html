The 2nd half would then turn out to be one sided with <u>U.O.E</u> on the receiving end of the attacks by <u>Kabarak University.</u> The visitors would then suffer an upset and ended up refusing to play and as a result the game was discontinued shortly into the start of the 2nd half with scores at 29:10 and the boys in red and white stripes would take the win setting a record of never suffering a defeat in their home grounds throughout the season. <br><b><u>STAY TUNED FOR MORE ARTICLES AS KABARAK TRAVEL TO NAIROBI THIS WEEKEND TO FACE OFF ZETECH OAKS IN THE LAST MATCH OF THIS SEASON!!!</u></b></p>
